    "We need to program to visit each of the subdirectories, open each prn file, and then process the file line by line while storing field values in a buffer. Since there are multiple lab reports in most of the prn files, the program will need to identify form feed characters and flush the buffer to a pipe delimited text file and then repeat with the next report. I prefer pipes (|) over commas because they are easier for me to read and it is far less likely for a stray pipe in the text to interfere with importing the pipe separated values (psv)."
