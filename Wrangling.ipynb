    "Put yourself in the shoes of a new medical director reporting to Stephanie Carpenter M.D., Chief Medical Officer for Gottagetta Life (GGL). Recently, Dr. Carpenter has succeeded in transferring the company's blood testing program to a new clinical lab, Abalone Labs (ABL). GGL began a modest trial of ABL in 2018. Test results from ABL were printed and provided to underwriters as a paper supplement to an otherwise paperless underwriting system. From 2023 into early 2024, nearly all of GGL's blood and urine testing were done at ABL. May 22, 2024 was the last date for print copies – from that point forward, ABL seriatim data transfers went straitght into the GGL underwriting system."
